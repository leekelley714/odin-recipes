    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Breakfast egg muffins with hash browns acting as the crust. Filled with eggs, sausage, red bell pepper, and cheese, these hash brown muffins make a delicious breakfast that will feed a crowd.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 links Johnsonville® Original breakfast sausage</li>
        <li>3 cups frozen country style shredded hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded 4-cheese Mexican blend cheese</li>
        <li>6 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh chives, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 12-cup muffin pan.</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add sausage links and cook, turning frequently, until well browned, 12 to 16 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the sausage is cooking, mix hash browns, melted butter, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until well combined. Press mixture into the bottom and sides of the prepared muffin cups.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly browned, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut sausage into 1/2-inch pieces. Stir cheese, beaten eggs, and bell pepper together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Remove hash brown crusts from the oven. Divide sausage between crusts, then spoon egg mixture over top. Sprinkle with chives.</li>
        <li>Return to the oven and bake until set, 13 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
